# Molecule Kitchen
by QuantumKya for Hack Club's Axiom YSWS

<br>

A sandbox where you can construct molecules. Place atoms and bond them together, covalently or ionically!

See the chemical formula of your molecule at any time.

Load one of a few template molecules hard-coded in by me (suggest other template molecules if you want!)

Share your molecules with others! Save as an image or as a loadable molecule file (.molecule or .json)

Choose light or dark mode, your preference will be saved locally.

Check out [the devlogs](devlog/DEVLOGS.md), which catalogue pretty much everything I did as I made the project!
