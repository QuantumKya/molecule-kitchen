## Devlog 10 - 11/8/2025
# *Manual* Catalysis

#### If only we had enzymes for that...

People can't do anything with my website if they don't know how to use it! So now there's a manual on screen!

When you select a tool, it will update the manual to the right of the canvas to explain how to use it. It'll be helpful.

I hope you like the descriptions, and if they're not good, I can change them if you tell me on the Github repository.
