# *Shortcuts* to Perfection

#### Darwinism?!

Someone pointed out that it's really tedious to change between editing modes with a dropdown. I fully agree! (To be honest, I kinda just made it that way to reuse code from the other dropdowns.)

I will rectify this tedium by introducing...
## Shortcuts
- Click and drag — move atoms
- Shift + Click and drag — Select area of atoms
- Ctrl + Click and drag — Move individual atom

- A — create atom at mouse's position
- Shift + A — delete atom at mouse's position
- B — create bond between two atoms (must press twice)
- Shift + B — delete bond between two atoms
- C — does nothing but fits the pattern in this list

Hopefully editing will be more manageable with these. Lexically transmit to you next time!
